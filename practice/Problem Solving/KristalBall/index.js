// 1) Apply Binary Search in infinite array.
// 2) Implement stack using Heap.
// 3) Check if string is rotated of other string.
// 4) A program to design a data structure nStacks , 
    //n number of Stacks having an overall fixed capacity of k elements . 
    //It should have operations like push(int element,int stackNumber) and pop(int stackNumber) , 
    //which should do respective operation on the given stack number . 
    //Underlying data structure to store elements should be only one array .
// 5. move all the zer
